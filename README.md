# Counter JavaScript test

# Includes
- **Browserify** for mudularity
- **Reactify** for jsx transforms
- **Jest** for tests
- **Express** to serve things of PORT 5000

# Commands
```sh
$ npm run setup     # install global dependencies, node modules and build production assets
$ npm run build     # build production assets
$ npm run build-dev # build un minified assets (for debugging)
$ npm test          # run tests
$ npm start         # start server on localhost:5000
```

## Problem
  Develop an app using JavaScript and ReactJS that allows you to track multiple counter totals in the browser.

  The app should consist of the following. A total counter, the ability to add a counter and the ability to increment and decrement that counter. (See layout for example UI).
